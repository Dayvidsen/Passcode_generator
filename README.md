# Passcode_generator
OSS For Passcode generation

Setting Up the Automated Passcode Generator
This project includes a Python script that generates a new random passcode and stores it in a text file every 4 hours. To automate this process, you'll need to set up a cron job on your machine. Follow these instructions to get everything up and running:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/passcode_generator.git
cd passcode_generator
Make sure to replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

2. Ensure Python 3 is Installed
This script requires Python 3. Verify that Python 3 is installed on your machine by running:

sh
Copy code
python3 --version
If Python 3 is not installed, you'll need to install it. On Ubuntu, you can install Python 3 by running:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
3. Set Up the Cron Job
To have the script run automatically every 4 hours, you'll set up a cron job.

Open your terminal and run the following command to edit your crontab:
sh
Copy code
crontab -e
At the end of the file, add the following line:
cron
Copy code
0 */4 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/passcode_generator/generate_passcode.py
Replace /path/to/your/passcode_generator with the actual path to the passcode_generator directory on your machine. You can find this path by navigating to the passcode_generator directory in your terminal and running pwd.

Save and close the file. The cron job is now set up and will run the script every 4 hours.
